# math-for-ai-builders

## Elevator pitch (3 lines)
Minimal, builder-oriented math notes focusing only on what is necessary to implement embeddings, attention, vector search, gradient updates, and basic ML logic.  
Avoids academic depth and focuses on intuition + runnable Python snippets.  
Designed to give hiring managers confidence that you understand the math behind your PoCs.

## What this proves (3 bullets)
- Ability to break down ML math into simple, builder-first explanations.  
- Coverage of only the essentials: vectors, dot products, softmax, basic probability, and gradients.  
- Shows initiative in creating structured learning artifacts.

## Repository structure
- `algebra/` — linear combinations, dot products  
- `calculus/` — derivatives, gradients  
- `ml-basics/` — loss functions, optimization  
- `vectors/` — norms, similarities  
- `probability/` — distributions, Bayes  
- `docs/` — overview + reference list

## Usage
